Question 1: What is the link to your github repository for this lab?
https://github.com/hz6/cmput404-lab4

Question 2: After starting a brand new Django application and running the runserver command, what does the browser show you?
It shows “The install worked successfully! Congratulations!” on the window

Question 3: After creating the first view within polls, what does the browser show you when navigating to / and to /polls respectively?
The “404 not found” is shown on route ‘/’ and the text "Hello, world. You're at the polls index." is shown on route ‘/polls‘

Question 4: What is a Django migration and why do we need them?
We need to build or edit a database according to the database settings.

Question 5: What do you see after you log into the Django administration site? From a high level, how do you get custom models to appear in the Django admin page?
Two model, Questions and Choices under POLLS tab. We can set our own models and their field and register the models in this file.

Question 6: What do you see when you go to /polls/38/ in your browser? What about /polls/38/results and /polls/38/vote? What happens when you don’t put a number, and instead use a string? How would you modify the urls.py file to allow arbitrary alphabetic characters?
/polls/38/ :"You're looking at question 38".
/polls/38/results : "You're looking at the results of question 38".
/polls/38/vote :"You're working on the question: 38".
Type error raises, question ID has been set to INT.
We have to change ID Type to str from int.

Question 7: Why is it a bad idea to hardcode urls into the templates?
Hardcoding would be required each time if urls changes.

Question 8: What are the benefits of using Django's generic views over writing views 'the hard way'? When should you use a generic view and when shouldn't you use a generic view?
Django's generic views can reduce redundancy. If multiple views have some features in common then we can use view, otherwise no.
